# kids-trip-planner-server

The diploma project focuses on developing a software application designed to streamline the organization of trips for children aged 0 to 17 years. This initiative aims to address the complexities involved in planning such activities, simplifying the process for caregivers, educators, and occasionally, parents.

The primary objective of this software is to facilitate the creation of personalized trips based on the specific preferences and needs of the children. It offers educators and caregivers the tools to design engaging and educational itineraries that are both enjoyable for the children and manageable for the organizers. For instance, an educator planning a trip for a secondary school class can utilize this application to create the experience to both entertain and educate the students. Similarly, a kindergarten teacher can use the system to ensure smooth operations and enhanced safety for younger children.

Key features of this program include the ability to store and access detailed information about the children, such as their medical conditions, allergies, and parental contact details. The system also enables users to filter activities based on location, ensuring that each trip is as convenient as it is enjoyable.

Throughout the development process, key components were constructed including a server that processes data requests and a client interface that is both intuitive and user-friendly. Additionally, a database has been established to maintain secure access to and storage of all trip-related data and user information. By providing these capabilities, the software not only enhances the logistical aspects of trip planning but also contributes significantly to the
educational and developmental experiences of the children involved.
